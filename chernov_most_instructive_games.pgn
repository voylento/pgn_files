{ Rook on the 7th rank, King to the 6th Capablanca’s play in the game that
follows provides us with a magic formula for conducting Rook and Pawn
endings: seize the seventh rank with your Rook, and advance your King to the sixth! Capablanca gives up a couple of valuable Pawns to get his King and
Rook onto the key squares. Once there, they keep the adverse King busy warding off threats of mate, and leave him no time to defend his Pawns. Four of these pawns fall victims in half-a-dozen moves, after which resistance is of course hopeless. Capa’s clear-cut, methodical play is so easy to
understand that the whole ending is a marvellous piece of instruction, and a thing of beauty as well. }

the secret in the strength of this move? It is this: (a) The Rook is in
perfect position to attack any Pawns that have not yet moved - those still standing on the second rank. (b) The Rook is prepared to attack any Pawns
that have moved, by getting behind them without loss of time. The Pawns would be under constant threat of capture, no matter how many squares they advanced on the file. (c) The Rook’s domination of the seventh rank confines the opposing King to the last rank, preventing him from taking any
part in the fighting. } 30... Rc6 31. g4 Nc4 { The Knight hastens to get into active play. Black naturally avoids 31 …

{ The King is a strong piece To those of us who worry about the safety of
the King, Tal’s play in this game is a joy and a revelation. Tal realizes
that the power of the King increases as the game progresses and as the pieces come flying off the board. By the time the ending has been reached, the
King is truly a formidable fighting piece. Watch Tal’s King stroll non chalantly into the heart of the enemy camp, gather up a couple of Pawns, and then prepare to escort one of his own Pawns to the Queening square. It is a treat to watch, an absorbing lesson in endgame procedure. }

{ Knight outpost at d5 Boleslavsky knows that a good grip on the center
almost always guaran tees the success of a King side attack. He therefore
plans to anchor a Knight at d5 - so firmly that it can never be driven away. To accom plish this he must do away with two enemy pieces that bear
down on that square, a Bishop and a Knight. He lures the Bishop off by a gift of a Pawn, and disposes of the Knight by pinning it and forcing its exchange. Once Boleslavsky’s Knight reaches the magic square d5, combinations appear out of the air as a reward, and the King side attack seems to
play itself. }

{ Aggressive Rook in the Ending Tarrasch plays the following game as though
he were giving a good friend a lesson in the art of winning an ending. “In
a Rook and Pawn ending,” Tarrasch used to say, “the Rook must be used aggres sively. It must either attack enemy Pawns, or give active support to the
advance of one its own Pawns to the Queening square.” Here, with the help of an active Rook that keeps the opponent under unremitting pressure, Tarrasch’s King and passed Pawn march methodically up the chessboard. As they move forward step by step, the opponent’s pieces are driven further and further
back until they reach the very edge of the board. There, they can put up little resistance to the inexorable advance of the passed Pawn. The classic simplicity of Tarrasch’s technique in the conduct of this ending is so impressive as to make it in my opinion: The Most Instructive Rook and Pawn Ending Ever Played. }

{ Weak pawns, weak squares, and mighty, mighty Knights It is amazing how
much instructive strategy Nimzovich can pack into a mere 23 moves. His
attack on a doubled Pawn leads to a weakening of a key square. On this important square Nimzovich plants a Knight so firmly that it cannot be
dislodged. He then forces open a file for the benefit of his Queen Rook. With that sector under control, he switches the King Knight over to the center of the board. The power generated by the centralized Knights is devastating. So great is the effect that Mattison feels compelled to resign,
though he hasn’t lost so much as a Pawn. Is chess of this sort an art or a science? In the hands of a crafts man like Nimzovich, it may be either. }

drawback of depriving the weak Pawn (at c4) of a defender.

{ Finesse in the ending For a description of Flohr’s skill in this game, I
commend you to Roget’s Thesaurus, where you will find such adjectives as
exquisite, elegant, artistic, and enchanting. Throughout the play there are delightful finesses and touches of originality. Who but Salo Flohr would
interrupt a series of exchanges, force an irreparable weakness, and then proceed to complete the exchanges? To my mind, this quiet little positional game, played with cry stalline clarity, outshines all the blazing combinations of a dozen wide-open, slam-bang attacking games. }

{ Passed pawn's Lust to Expand “A passed Pawn increases in strength,” says
Capablanca, “as the number of pieces on the board diminishes.” In this game
Fischer demonstrates in brilliant style the power that is pent-up in a passed Pawn. Note how Fischer drives off the blockaders of the Pawn, and
disposes of the pieces that impede its progress. Note also how Fischer’s persistent threats against unprotected Pawns and pieces keep his opponent on the run while he gains precious time. Fischer’s restless energy in attack is reminiscent of the fire and dash of that other prodigy who dazzled the
chess world with his mastery - Paul Morphy. }
1. e4 Nf6 { This defense to 1 e4 was first played in serious tournament chess in
1921, when Alekhine beat Steiner with it at Budapest. Previous to this no
master had ever ventured on 1 … ♘f6. It seemed a sad waste of time to let the Knight be chased around by Pawns, aside from the fact that these
Pawns were building up an imposing center for White. Alekhine showed that the Pawn center was not so strong as it looked, and that the advanced Pawns could be vulnerable objects of attack. } 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 (3... Nc6 4. c4 Nb6 5. d5 Nxe5 (5...

{ Rook and pawn ending All chess players (and that includes you and me)
must have a sadistic streak or we would not enjoy seeing a fellow
chessplayer being methodi cally and remorselessly crushed. In this game Smyslov gets an iron grip on the center almost from the start. He tightens
the grip move by move in the style made famous by Tarrasch. Something has to give way, and it turns out to be a Pawn that weakens and can not avoid being captured. Once Smyslov is a Pawn ahead he brings the game quickly to an ending. He brings it in fact to one of those Rook and Pawn
endings which are so confounded instructive. His treatment is more than worthy of note, as Smyslov plays it beautifully. His skill in that department is now so evident as to find his name mentioned in the same breath with those of Capablanca and Rubin stein. There is no higher praise. }

sometimes while apparently very simple they are in reality extremely intricate.” We can appreciate this particular ending if we have an outline of Smyslov’s general plan. White’s Rook will assume its best position - at a7, where it dominates the all-important seventh rank, and at the same time
keeps the adverse passed a-Pawn under constant attack, no matter how far it advances on the file. White’s King will advance under a Pawn shelter to g6, where it is in position, assisted by the Rook, to remove Black’s King side Pawns.

{ King in the center If once a man delays Castling and his King remains in
the center, files will open up against him, Bishops sweep the board, Rooks
will dominate the seventh rank, and Pawns turn into Queens. Irving Chernev. The moment I wrote this I recalled another piece of advice, moral in
nature: If once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to incivility and procrastination. Thomas De Quincey. }

{ The shifting attack The attack of a tactician can be troublesome to meet
- that of a strategist even more so. Whereas the tactician’s threats may be
unmistakable, the strategist confuses the issue by keeping things in abeyance. He threatens to threaten! Take this game for instance: Reshevsky posts
a Knight at d6 to get a grip on the center. Then he establishes a passed Pawn on one wing to occupy his opponent on the Queen side. Finally he stirs up the position on the King side. What does the poor bewildered opponent do? How can he defend everything at once? Where will the blow fall? Watch
Reshevsky keep Najdorf on the run, as he shifts the attack from side to side! }

{ Every move a threat One of the reasons Lasker was a tough man to beat was
that he made use of ideas in his games years before they were discovered by
the Hypermoderns. Here for example he demonstrates the Nimzovich con cept that a restricted position is not necessarily disadvantageous. What counts is
the amount of pent-up energy in the position, and the possibility of this energy exploding. I think you will enjoy the way Lasker lets loose with ten moves in a row, each of them containing a threat! }

advice: “When you are conscious not to have violated the rules laid down,
you should accept the sacri fice of an important Pawn, as the King Pawn, Queen Pawn, or one of the Bishop Pawns. If you do not, as a rule, the
Pawn which you have rejected will become very troublesome to you. Do not accept the sacrifice, however, with the idea of maintaining your material advantage at the expense of development. Such a policy never pays in the end. By far the better plan is to give the Pawn up after your opponent
has made some exertions to gain it.” } 5. d4 Be7 6. Qe2 (6. dxe5 { lets Black free his game by } 6... d5 7. exd6 Nxd6) 6... Nd6 7. Bxc6 bxc6 8. dxe5 Nb7 { The Knight retreats, but after it makes its way back

{ A touch of Jujitsu Petrosian must have the spark of genius! How else
could he, with a few mysterious moves, cause the quick collapse of so
eminent a player as Korchnoi? By means of subtle strategy Petrosian brings about a position where his opponent’s pieces must depend on each other
for support. The Queen defends a Knight which defends a Rook which defends a Pawn. With the skill of a jujitsu expert, Petrosian applies pressure to the critical points, and Korchnoi is forced to resign at once. }

{ The Kingside attack “A plan is made for a few moves only,” says Reuben
Fine, “not for the whole game.” This may be so, but here is an instance
where Tarrasch maps out a course of play leading practically to mate, from so early a stage as the eighth move in the game! His attack on a Pawn
forces an exchange which pries open the g-file. On this file, leading straight to von Scheve’s King, Tarrasch posts both his Rooks. Then he adds to this concentration of power by swinging the Queen over to that area. The way these heavy pieces then crash through the barriers is in itself an
object lesson in the art of conducting an assault against the King. }

comment on 7 … ♘e4: “The decisive error. After the exchange of Knights,
Black’s capturing Pawn becomes weak and needs pro tection by … f5. It is then attacked by f3, forcing Black to exchange and open the g-file for White.
Thereupon there ensues a combined attack of White’s Queen, both Rooks and the Queen Bishop against the g-Pawn (the key stone of the Castled position), an attack which is irresistible. I know of no game in all of chess literature in which it is possible to conceive so detailed a plan, leading
almost to mate, and in which the remaining 20 moves lead up to a catastrophe.” } 8. Nxe4 dxe4 9. Nd2 Bb4 { Of this move Tarrasch says characteristically, “Had Black fore seen the

{ Magnificient Outpost “The Knight at c3,” says Nimzovich, “is under
obligation, the moment the enemy gives him the chance, of undertaking an
invasion of the center by ♘d5.” Smyslov has a Knight at c3, but does not intend to sit by idly and wait for such a chance. The key square is
heavily guarded, but Smyslov finds a way to get rid of its defen ders. Once they are disposed of, Smyslov plants his Knight firmly at d5, and stabilizes the center. He then turns his attention to the King side, and breaks through quickly with a brilliant attack. }

powerful Bishops, or simply stay there and exert strong pressure on the center. The ideal set-up for Black is something like this: The a-Pawn at a6, to prepare for … b5, and to prevent White from attacking the Queen by ♘b5. The b-Pawn at b5. The Bishops at d7 and e7. The King Knight at f6.

{ The Art of Exchanging pieces Nothing exciting seems to happen in this
game, yet it is a joy to play through. In it we see an interesting aspect
of Capablanca’s wondrous technique - his inimitable flair for extracting an advantage from the most routine of procedures. Here for example, Miss
Menchik tries to force a draw by exchanging as many pieces as possible. Far from avoiding these attempts to simplify the game, Capablanca wel comes the exchanges, and emerges from each of them with a slightly superior position. By the time most of the pieces have been cleared away, his
positional advantage is strong enough to yield a Pawn. One extra Pawn is all Capablanca needs, and since he had an incomparable faculty for making all endings look easy, it is a treat to watch him win this one. }

{ The isolated pawn An isolated Pawn stands all by itself, away from any
fellow Pawns. It looks weak, since it can only be protected by pieces.
Despite its seeming frailty the isolated Pawn is not easily susceptible to capture. For with every piece that threatens to remove it, there is a
friendly piece ready to come to its rescue. It takes ingenuity to find a means of procedure. Lasker has that ingenuity, and this is how he proceeds: He begins by a direct attack on the Pawn. If that does not succeed he attacks the pieces protecting the Pawn. If that effort is repulsed he
attacks the Pawns that protect the pieces that protect the isolated Pawn. This undermining of the defensive struc ture at the base is bound to cause a fatal weakening and a consequent loss of material. In this case, Lasker wins a Rook for a Knight and two Pawns. It may not seem like a great deal, but in the hands of a fine player it is enough to be deci sive. The way Lasker goes about forcing resignation is a lesson in the art of winning a won game. [editor's note also a great game for hanging pieces] }

just by being there.

{ Variety of themes This game flows along with such grace, charm and wit,
it is hard to realize that it offers more than mere entertainment. In the
short space of 37 moves it offers an insight into such useful ideas in chess strategy as: (1) The Advantage of the Two Bishops, (2) Pressure on the
Black Squares, (3) Majority of Pawns on the Queen side, (4) Sacrifice of a Piece to Create Passed Pawns, and (to crown it all), (5) The Triumphal March of the Passed Pawns. }

turn into a whirlwind attack. Its tactical objective is an attack on
Black’s Castled position on the King side. Its strategical objective is to create a majority of Pawns on the Queen side, which can be decisive in
the endgame. The characteristic formation is as follows: The d-Pawn in the center, supported by the c-Pawn as an understudy. The e-Pawn at e3, enabling the development of the King Bishop. Later on, the Pawn advances to e4 to let the Queen Bishop come into the game. The King Knight
develops at f3, ready to seize the outpost e5, or perhaps to attack by ♘g5. The Queen Knight develops at d2 to support the thrust e4. The Queen is best posted at e2, to back up the King Pawn and to permit the Rooks to get in touch with each other. The Rooks are generally most useful at e1 and d1, on files which are likely to be opened. } 6... Bd6 7. O-O O-O 8. Qe2 { Preparing to advance the e-Pawn, which will open up the game

{ Systematic strangulation “This is a game in which there are no
combinations. Yet, after a modest beginning, White cramps his op ponent’s
game more and more until it is completely crippled - and all this without any noticeable blunder on Black’s part. That is the highest
triumph of chess strategy.” Tarrasch said this, believed it and lived by it. In this positional masterpiece, Tarrasch does not let Showalter develop his pieces pro perly, stifles attempts at counter attack, cramps his opponent’s game move by move, and finally crushes him to the
wall. There are combinations in the game, despite Tarrasch’s assertion, but they are hidden away in the notes. They show what might have happened to Showalter, had he not played as well as he did. }

he moves a piece twice in the opening! } 6. Bd3! { “The first principle of attack - ” says Reuben Fine, “Don’t let the
opponent develop!” White’s move prevents 6 … f5, an attack on the base of

side by playing ♘e1 followed by f4 and f5. But if he were to play 20 ♘e1 at once, the reply 20 … ♗g5 would force an exchange of Bishops and free Black’s game some what.

{ Good Bishop & Bad Bishop Some of our modern concepts in chess strategy
might have shocked the old-timers. Take this game for instance, where
Rossolimo exchanges pieces to rid the board of an enemy Bishop standing quietly at its home square! It turns out though that Barden is left with the
bad Bishop (one hemmed in by Pawns) against a powerful Knight of Rossolimo’s. In the hands of a fine player, this is practically the equivalent of being a piece ahead, so Rossolimo quickly works up an attack. In the ensuing complications he wins a Pawn, and then proceeds to cut down all the
pieces in sight. The ending, with Pawns only, is no problem at all. This is pro chess of a high order! }

{ Coup de Grâce Even the mighty Alekhine, who played more brilliant games
than any other man who ever lived, did not pluck combinations out of thin
air. Even he had to abide by Lasker’s dictum: “In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combina tions, abstain from violent moves, aim for
small advantages, accumu late them, and only after having attained these ends search for the combination - and then with all the power of will and intellect, because then the combination must exist, however deeply hidden.” Note how Alekhine, ever alert for opportunity, anchors pieces on strong
squares, seizes open files, doubles Rooks on the seventh rank, and centralizes his King. Centralizes his King? Good Hea vens! Alekhine’s King walks up the board practically in the midgame and steals a Rook in broad daylight! If there are combinations to be found (and Lasker assures us there are) Alekhine is the man who can find them. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bg5 O-O 6. e3 Nbd7 { White has a happy time of it in this line of the Queen’s Gambit. All he
has to do to get a good game is make natural moves. Black, on the other
hand, usually has trouble developing the pieces on the Queen side. The Queen Knight stands awkwardly at d7, and shuts in the Bishop. Bringing the
Knight out at c6 though would be far worse. It would block the c-Pawn whose job it is to attack the center by … c5, while the plight of the Queen Bishop would not be mitigated - it would still be shut in. } 7. Rc1 c6 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Bd3 dxc4 { With this move and the next (Capablanca’s freeing maneuver) Black has a
fair chance of achieving equality. Other lines are less promising, e.g. } (9... a6) (9... h6 10. Bf4! a6 11. cxd5 Nxd5 12. Nxd5 exd5 13. O-O Nf6 14. h3 { [%cal Gc1b1,Gb2b4,Ga2a4,Gb4b5] }) 10. Bxc4 Nd5 11. Ne4 { The theorists, including Alekhine, consider 11 ♗xe7 to be White’s best
move, but Alekhine often plays inferior or little-analyzed moves to throw
his opponents on their own resources, or to bring about complications in which they are not quite at home. } (11. Bxe7) 11... f5? { This move is not good, since it weakens his black squares, and saddles
Black with a backward e- Pawn. An enemy Knight can establish itself on his
e5 square, without fear of being driven away by Pawns. “From this point,” says Alekhine, “Black’s game may be considered strategically lost, which
is not to say that the realization of victory will be an easy matter.” A preferable defense was 11 … ♗xg5 12 ♘exg5 ♘f8, though Black still faced the prospect of a long, hard winter. } (11... Bxg5 12. Nexg5 Nf8) 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 13. Ned2 b5? { Another strategical error, and again an important black square
(c5) is weakened. White, as we shall see, utilizes this square as a pivot
for his pieces - the Knight, the Queen and then one of the Rooks. White also obtains control of the only open file. It makes a fine avenue of entry
into the adverse position. } { [%csl Rc5] } 14. Bxd5! { Very good! Alekhine gets rid of a Knight that is posted strongly in the
center, and prepares to operate on the open file. } 14... cxd5 15. O-O a5 { [%csl Rb3,Rd2][%cal Ra5a4] } 16. Nb3 { This must be played at once, as otherwise 16 … a4 keeps the
Knight out. The Knight is of course headed for c5, the magic square. } { [%cal Gb3c5] } 16... a4 17. Nc5 { This forces an exchange of Knights, after which White’s other Knight can
settle on c5 (or on e5) without fear of being disturbed. } 17... Nxc5 18. Qxc5! { The right way to capture! “Weak points or holes in the opponent’s
position,” says Tarrasch, “must be occupied by pieces, not by Pawns.” } 18... Qxc5 19. Rxc5 { White has the advantage in force, space and time. In force: the Knight,
which will be posted unassailably at e5, sup ported by a Pawn, is stronger
than a Bishop - especially this one, which is limited purely to defense. In space: his Rooks will dominate the only open file. In time: two of his
pieces are in active play, while Black has none. } 19... b4 20. Rfc1 Ba6 { Black hopes to oppose Rooks on the c-file. } { [%cal Ge8c8] } 21. Ne5! { The Knight arrives just in time to put a stop to any such
fancies! If Black tries to dispute possession of the c-file by 21 … ♖ec8,

{ The powerful Passed Pawns The modern master tries to accumulate slight
advantages, though they may not promise an immediate reward. In this game,
Petrosian’s posi tional superiority consists in having two Bishops against Knight and Bishop, and in the pressure that his Rooks exert on an open
file. It is little enough, but a sudden sacri fice of the exchange transforms these somewhat intangible advantages into one that can be turned quickly into account. Petrosian is left with two connected passed Pawns in the center, facing an enemy Rook. This Rook, strangely enough, is helpless to
stop at least one of the Pawns from reaching the Queening square. }

{ Bishop and a half Strictly speaking, this is not a two-Bishop game,
although it has most of the attractive features connected with games where
two Bishops oppose two Knights, or a Knight and Bishop. Smyslov takes it out of that cate gory by exchanging one of his Bishops for a Knight. Of
course he punishes the Pawn that removed his Bishop by capturing it ten moves later. In the midgame, Smyslov’s Pawns swarm over the board like little black ants, and make things un comfortable for the opponent, whose pieces can find no resting place on any decent central square. In the
ending, Smyslov’s lone Bishop (one is all he needs, ap parently) travelling along the white squares, spreads terror among the enemy’s Pawns on the Queen side, fixed as they are on white squares. The whole game is in Smyslov’s best style, which is to say that it is a delight to play over. }

{ Prophetic Strategy It is always exciting to come across an unknown
masterpiece, especially when the strategy it features is so far ahead of
its time. I like the way pieces are manipulated, and an open file utilized, to establish a strong outpost at b7. I particularly relish the way
combination play at one end of the board culminates in the gain of a Pawn at the other. I find the climax amusing, with Black’s Knight im prisoned by a Bishop, while his King struggles desperately to be in two places at once. Amusing - if you are not yourself caught in a like dilemma. }

{ Problem-like Finale The student of chess strategy will be fascinated by
the way certain elements of position play - centrali zation, weaknesses on
the black squares, Knight outpost at e5, Bishop hemmed in by Pawns - are treated here. The connoisseur of grace and ease of style will find
sufficient incentive to play this game over (more than once, I am sure) mindful of Leonard Barden’s comment on it in his excellent book AGuide to Chess Openings, “The whole game runs with a smooth logic characteristic of the greatest masterpieces." }

{ Board with excitement From the very start of this magnificent game, Keres
does not allow his opponent a moment’s breathing spell. He threatens the
King side, he threatens the Queen side, he threatens the center, and the whole board vibrates with the fury of his attack. When the decisive
combination does materialize (as inevitably it must when a Rook on the seventh rank controls the Queen side, a Knight at f5 terrorizes the King side, and the Queen dominates the center) it is a pleasing one, and a fitting climax to the impeccable strategy that made it possible. }

{ Four endings in one This game and the next were played between Blackburne
and Weiss in the first two rounds of a double-round tournament. This game,
the first between them, was won by Weiss, who played the Bishop ending beautifully. Black burne, on the other hand, conducted the ending indifferently,
hemming in his own Bishop with Pawns. In the second round, the game once again came down to a Bishop ending. What happened in the interval I don’t know, but this time it was Blackburne who demonstrated the win in classic style. He played it like the man who wrote the book, or at least that chapter in
it called, “How to win a Bishop ending with a Pawn ahead.” Incidentally, this Bishop ending was preceded by an ending of two Bishops against Knight and Bishop, followed by a Queen ending, and finally by a Pawn ending. Four endings in one game! }

{ Bishop & pawn ending Deluxe Blackburne lost his first round game against
Weiss in the great New York Tournament of 1889, but got his revenge when
the players met again in the second round. What made the victory particularly sweet was the fact that Blackburne achieved it by using the very weapons
with which he was beaten - Bishop and Pawns against Bishop and Pawns. It is doubtful that even Rubinstein in his palmiest days could have played the ending in more convincing style. }

{ Brilliant career of a pawn The major theme of this game, with suitable
sub-heads, could very well be: THE PASSED PAWN (1) Creation of the Pawn.
(2) Blockade of the Pawn. (3) Removal of the Blockade. (4) Triumph of the Pawn. Another phase of this game (a minor theme?) I find even more
interesting. Early in the play, instead of the usual struggle for posi tional advantage as the necessary preliminary to a decisive combination later on, we have here a series of little combinations whose purpose is to acquire ultimately an advantage in position! A good deal of sharp fighting
revolves about the efforts of one side to limit, and the other side to increase the attacking range of Black’s King Bishop. This seeming reversal of theory is typical of the play of today’s masters, who refuse to let their thinking be bound by convention.

{ Dispatching the King's Musketeers There is nothing prosaic in the way
Petrosian handles a King side attack. He can discover witty ideas in the
most well-worn positions. In this game, he finds an original means of breaking into the opponent’s territory. He begins by making three aggressive
moves in a row with his Queen. These three moves uproot the three Pawns protecting the King in the Castled position. There still remains one strong defender of the King to be disposed of - the enemy Queen! Petrosian lures the Queen away by an offer of his Bishop, and then storms the
bastions. }

{ The power of position play Simul: Black players are Germann + Miller +
Skillcorn This is a typical Capablanca game. Which is to say, that its
outward appearance of classic simplicity may conceal inner workings of fiendish ingenuity. Capablanca squeezes out a win from a position where his
advantage, acquired in the opening, and carried through the midgame into the ending, is so slight as to be almost imperceptible. It consists in having a King that is situated closer to the center, and a Rook that is more active than his opponent’s. This is little enough, but it enables
Capablanca to set his sights on a Pawn, surround it and remove it. Once he is a Pawn ahead, and a road cleared for the advance of a passed Pawn, the win is easy for Capablanca. All this is done smoothly and effortlessly, as though Capablanca were demonstrating a composed ending whose terms were, ‘White to move and win.’ We may not hope ever to play like Capablanca, but we can learn a great deal about the technique of winning by watching him in action. }

the position through his control of the black squares. His opponent’s Pawns are held in a grip of steel, and are unable to move without loss. The
consequence is that the pieces behind the Pawns are helpless to come into the game. White’s pieces, on the other hand, are unrestrained, and free to roam all over the board. The exploitation of White’s su periority is quite entertaining, the King himself giving a remarkable display of his

active services of his Queen Rook. } { [%csl Ra5,Ra8] } 21... Kd7 { The King comes to the center for the endgame. The
Rooks are now united, while the King heads for d6 to support the c-Pawn,
whose advance would help free his game. } { [%cal Gd7d6,Gc6c5] } 22. b3 Ba6 { The only flight square open to the unhappy Bishop! } 23. Bb6! { And now an attack on the Pawn! } 23...

Black’s King cannot reach d6, his Rooks cannot seize any open files, his
Bishop has little scope (one square as against eight by White’s) and his Pawn center is paralyzed. White has a won game, strategi cally. What
remains is the matter of winning it, a technique the masters take for granted, but one not always easily demonstrated. It is done here in magnificent style. } { [%csl Ra6,Rc8,Rd7,Rh8] } 25... Kc7 26. Kd4! { Tightens the noose! The strength-ening of White’s grip on the black
squares prevents the opponent’s center Pawns from moving, and this in turn
keeps the pieces behind the Pawns from taking an active part in the game. The King’s last move also clears the way for the entrance of the King
Rook, who will make good use of the e-file. } 26... Bd7 { Black will try to maneuver the Bishop over to the King
side, say to g6. His King Rook seems to have a great deal of scope, but
what does it avail him? If it moves to b8 (as good a file as there is) at what point can it penetrate? There is no useful square on that file for the
Rook. } { [%cal Gd7e8,Ge8g6] } 27. Rhe1 { Much stronger than the immediate occupation of e5 by
the King. White intends to use this key square as a transfer point for his
Rook on its way to the g-file. After the Rook gets there, White will settle his King at e5, and tighten his grip on the black squares. } { [%cal Ge1e5,Ge5g5] } (27. Ke5) 27... h5 28. Re5 { Second stop on the way to g5. } 28... g6 29. Rg5 { Attacks the g-Pawn, and simultaneously makes room
for further entry by the King. } { [%csl Rg6][%cal Gd4e5] } 29... Rg8 { The Pawn must be protected, and this is of course preferable to 29 … ♖h6,
and the Rook has no mobility to speak of. } (29... Rh6 { [%csl Rh6] }) 30. Ke5 { Further penetration along the convenient black squares. The threat is now
31 ♔f6 (attack the g-Pawn twice) 31 … ♗e8 32 ♖e1 (stronger than 32 ♔xe6)
followed by ♖xe6. } 30... Be8 { Black’s poor Bishop is sadly shut in by the five Pawns standing on the
same color as the Bishop } 31. Re1 { Before committing himself to decisive action, White applies more
pressure. Notice how a master player puts every piece to work before he
strikes a blow. } (31. Kxe6 Bd7+ 32. Kf6 (32. Kf7) 32... Bf5) 31... Ra8 { To get back into the game, this Rook has to return home! } (31... Kd7 32. Kf6) 32. Kf6! { This completes the concept of encirclement. Notice the effects of the
arrangement of Black’s Pawns at e6, d5 and c6. Black’s own pieces are kept
under restraint, while White’s can utilize the weakened black squares c5, d4, e5 and f6 to effect an entrance into the vitals of the enemy
position. Notice also that these black squares are ‘holes’ (as Steinitz called them), squares from which pieces cannot be dislodged by the opponent’s Pawns. White does not resort to brutal attack or to intricate combination to accomplish his purpose, but puts his trust in the dynamic power
inherent in a crushing positional superiority } 32... Bd7 33. g3 (33. Rxg6 Rxg6+ 34. Kxg6 Rg8+ 35. Kxh5 Rxg2 { turns Black suddenly into the aggressor }) 33... Rae8 34. Ree5 { Further blockade of the e-Pawn, making it
almost impossible for Black to free himself. This is stronger than
capturing the g-Pawn, since that Pawn is doomed anyway. Four of Black’s Pawns are now stopped dead in their tracks, while the remaining two can advance
but only to be captured. } { [%csl Ra5,Rc6,Rd5,Re6,Rg6,Rh5] } 34... Rh8 { “While there’s life …” } 35. Rxg6 Rh7 36. Rg7 { White keeps on gaining ground. Now he invades the seventh rank. } 36... Reh8 37. Rxh7 { Simplest, hence the scientific way to force the win. In endings where one
side has a material advantage, the prescribed strategy is to exchange
pieces, not Pawns, and bring it to a position with Pawns only. Endings with Pawns only on the board are the easiest endings to win. } 37... Rxh7 38. Kg6! { With every reduction of pieces from the board, the power of the King
increases. Now the King threatens the Rook and helps attack the h-Pawn. } 38... Rh8 { Does White settle the issue now by taking the h-Pawn? No, no, a thousand
times no! } 39. Kg7! { White’s actual move banishes the Rook from the premises. Look at that
King! } (39. Rxh5 Be8+ { and Black wins a whole Rook and the game. How easy it is to go wrong in a
simple ending! }) 39... Rd8 40. Rxh5 Be8 41. Rh7 { A well-trained Rook settles down on the seventh rank instinctively } 41... Rd7+ { This leads to an exchange of Rooks } 42. Kh6 Rxh7+ 43. Kxh7 Bh5 { A flicker of hope! The Bishop rushes to get at White’s
Queen side Pawns. } { [%csl Ra4,Rb3,Rc2] } 44. h4 { The Pawns on the Queen’s wing cannot be rescued, so White starts the
Pawns on the King side rolling. } 44... Bd1 45. c3 Bxb3 46. g4 Kd7 { The King hastens to stop the Pawns } (46... Bxa4 47. f5 Bc2 (47... Kd7 48. f6 Ke8 49. Kg7) 48.

{ The singular Strategy of Steinitz's play “Place the contents of the
chessbox in your hat,” said Bird, “shake them up vigorously, pour them on
the board at a height of two feet, and you get the style of Steinitz.” Bird may have been joking, but to players brought up on the
straightforward attacking and com bination play of Anderssen and Morphy, the weird-looking, time-wasting maneuvers of Steinitz to obtain a trivial advantage in position seemed far removed from the gallant “when Knights were bold” spirit of chess. And yet it is from Steinitz and his queer
moves that we learn so much about game-winning strategy. It is from Steinitz, whose play might have horrified La Bourdonnais and Morphy, that we discover the funda mentals of position play. In the early part of the following game, we may be amused by the unconventionality of Steinitz’s play - the delayed Castling, the absurd-looking moves, the quixotic journey of a Knight over five squares to reach a remote outpost at the side of the board. But by the time we get to the end of the game, we will have learned a great deal about modern chess strategy. }
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 { Steinitz’s idea (with 5 f4) is to support the e-Pawn (which cramps Black)

many Pawns on white squares greatly circumscribes the activity of the Queen Bishop } 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3! { This move, seizing control of the black squares, marks the beginning of
White’s positional attack. White plans to win the game by taking possession
of the most important squares in sight, eventually leaving his opponent without a single playable move } 16... Qd8 17. Nd4 { The Knight leaps to the center, gaining a move by the attack on the
e-Pawn } 17... Nf8 18. O-O h5 { This move, intended to prevent the opening of an attack by 19 g4, is a
weakening of Black’s Pawn structure. It also accentuates the weakness of
his black squares, on which White’s pieces can settle with impunity, since no Pawns can drive them away. The sole guardian of the black squares in
fact is the King Bishop - and Steinitz intends to do away with that piece! } 19. Nc3! { The beginning of a remarkable Knight’s Tour. The Knight is headed for a5,
an important black square located at the edge of the board! From there the
Knight will be in position to dispatch the King Bishop - the one that guards the black squares. } 19... Kf7 { Defends the e-Pawn with the King, so that the Knight can get back into

and seize control of the file. } 25... Qb8 26. Qc2! { This move gives White undisputed possession of the only open file } 26... Bd8 { To prevent further invasion by 27 ♕c7, but Steinitz (like love) will find

glorious square g5 as a base for operations, and his Bishop has black
squares all over the board at its disposal. Let’s look at Black’s situation: The Knight must not move - it’s pinned. The Rook must not move - it
guards the Knight. The Bishop must not move - it will be captured if it does. Meanwhile, Black must meet the threat of 33 ♗h4. } 32... Ke8 { The King moves over to protect the Knight, as otherwise 33 ♗h4 drives

decent move left, zugzwang can be quite embarrassing. Let us look at the
choice open to Black: (1) The King may not move. (2) The Bishop may move, only at the risk of instant capture. (3) The Rook may move to b8, when 36

{ Odyssey of a Isolated Pawn An isolated Pawn looks anemic, and generally
is a weakling. Tartakover used to say, “An isolated Pawn spreads gloom all
over the chess board.” And this only confirmed what Philidor had said, many years before Tartakover was born, “A Pawn, when separated from his
fellows, will seldom or never make a fortune.” That an isolated Pawn can become dangerous though (especially if it becomes a passed Pawn) is the theme of this fascinating game. As the number of pieces on the board diminishes, the power of the Pawn increases, and with every step it takes, its
menace becomes greater. The entire army of the enemy may be tied up trying to halt its progress. Znosko-Borovsky’s masterly treat ment of his isolated Pawn in the game that follows elicited Lasker’s admiring comment, “It is a game of classic simplicity and beauty.” }
1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 { Highly recommended by Dr. Tarrasch, who says, “This I hold to be the
best, although I must add that I am almost completely alone in holding that
opinion. The defense is based upon the undeniably correct idea that in the Queen’s Gambit … c5 is the freeing move for Black, and must therefore
be made as soon as possible. By this defense Black gets an isolated Pawn, but a fine free game for his pieces.” } 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Bg5 { This is not as strong as 6 g3, followed by 7 ♗g2, the

{ Zugzwang, the invincible weapon “The best way to learn endings, as well
as openings,” says Capablanca in Chess Fundamentals, “is from the games of
the masters.” Here is a game that bears out the wisdom of this advice. It flares up, almost from the beginning, with exciting combination play - the
kind that inspires you to exercise your own imagination in the opening. Then it plunges suddenly past the midgame right into the ending, one of the most remarkable ever seen on a chessboard. It is played with the care, thought and finesse that is characteristic of Lasker at his best. And with
Lasker at his best, we can always add to our understanding of the endgame. }

{ Symphony of combinationsWhat is it in a game that qualifies it to win a
prize for brilliancy? Is it the unexpected sacrifice of material? If so,
this game features an offer of a Knight, followed later by the sacrifice of two Pawns on the seventh rank, just a step away from the Queening square.
Is it originality of ideas? Here, to give one instance, we see that a piece attacked only once may be in deadly danger, though protected by King, Queen and both Rooks. Is it a finely-played ending? This one, with a magic Morphy move in it, is elegance itself. Whatever it is that makes a game
such as this worthy of the brilliancy prize, it holds us spellbound with its wealth of imaginative ideas. }

{ Escorting the potential Queen “The winning of a Pawn among good players
of even strength,” says Capablanca, “often means the winning of the game.”
The extra Pawn can be turned into a Queen, as the good player knows, and with a Queen ahead he can beat anybody in the world. The technique of
transforming a Pawn into a Queen is shown more simply, clearly and concisely in the following game than in any other game I know. Watch particularly how Schlechter makes use of his King to escort the passed Pawn up the board. Note how the King zig-zags alongside the Pawn,protecting it from attack,
while himself evading checks by the Rook. The method once learned is not easily forgotten. }

{ The Pillsbury Bind “The scheme of a game,” says Réti, “is played on
positional lines, the decision of it, is as a rule, effected by
combinations. ” The following game, one of the unknown masterpieces of chess, illustrates this principle of strategy beautifully. Early in the
play, White gets a grip on the Queen side (known as the Pillsbury Bind) which keeps his opponent busy on that wing. Then he conjures up threats of mate to harass him on the other. Rendered desperate by trying to prevent the collapse of his Queen side, while at the same time
warding off check mate on the King side, Black falls victim to the inevitable combination - in this case a pretty one. }

Pawn, and is vulnerable to invasion by an enemy piece. Such a piece can settle itself comfortably in one of these holes, secure in the knowledge that no enemy Pawn can disturb it. White’s plan is classical in its simplicity. He will advance the h-Pawn to h4, h5 and h6, and then play ♕g7
mate. If the Pawn is captured en route, say when it reaches h5, mate by the Rook is the instant penalty. } { [%cal Gh2h6] } 28... Rd6 { Black vacates the square d8 for his Queen, the only

warding off the accumulating threats. Black has three problems, each on a

White’s stranglehold. (3) In the middle, he must rescue any pieces that are exposed. } (29. h4 Qa8 30. h5 Qd8 { and the threat of mate is parried. }) 29... Rfd8 (29... Qb8 30. Be4 Rc8 31. h4 Qc7 32.

found something overlooked by the master. The reason the master didn’t see the shorter line is that he was not looking for it in the first place! The move with which he wins is the one whose effects he saw earlier and analyzed thoroughly before starting his final combination. Once the series of
forcing moves clicks, there is no reason at all for him to waste time looking for other moves that might win.

Tarrasch’s Queen Knight makes 13 of the 37 moves in the game, holds the
enemy Rooks at bay, captures Pawns here and there, and as a final touch, clears the way for a passed Pawn to become a Queen. From the technical
standpoint, the game offers a valuable lesson in the art of getting the most out of a minute advantage. Especially interesting is the way the Knight provokes a weakness which enables it to gain complete possession of d6 - a square the Knight visits three times! }

{ Web of Black Squares Certain squares on the chessboard seem to be vital
nerve centers. Control of them gives a player a tremendous positional
advantage - nearly always a decisive one. In the following game, Schlechter’s overall strategy is impressive, but never more so than in the way he
utilizes the key squares e5, f6 and h6. He occupies the latter two with his pieces, and gets a powerful grip on the King side. As for e5, not only does Schlechter secure possession of that square, but he makes use of it as a convenient jumping-off place for his pieces. It is occupied in turn
by a Knight, the Queen, a Pawn, and then the other Knight. When the King himself threatens to assume command from there, it is an indication to the opponent that it’s time to resign. The game is a large-scale master -piece, with the action taking place over the full range of the board - the King side, the center, and the Queen side. It is undoubtedly the greatest game Schlechter ever played, and for that matter, one of the greatest games anybody ever played }
1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 f5 { Black’s arrangement of Pawns is known as the Stonewall Formation. Its
purpose is to create a strong Pawn support for a Knight at e5, and with the
center made secure, to play for an attack on the King side. There are two drawbacks to the Stonewall. One is that the square e5 is weakened: an
enemy piece posted there could not be driven away by Pawns. The second is the weakening of Black’s Queen Bishop, whose range of action is restricted by the Pawns standing on white squares. } 4.

seven moves. He would capture the passed Pawn, then the f- and h-Pawns. White’s King would then be behind the g-Pawn, which could freely go on to become a Queen. } 0-1

{ In the book of the New York 1924 Tournament, Alekhine says of the game
between Capablanca and Yates, “Capablanca’s planning of the game is so full
of that freshness of his genius for position play that every hyper-modern player can only envy him.” In the game that follows, Capablanca shows his
consummate mastery of all styles of play! The subtle strategy initiated by his 10th move could have been a pro found concept of Lasker’s; the powerful restraining moves by the Pawns are worthy of a Philidor; the switch attack from one side of the board to the other is reminiscent of a Bogolyubov
attack; the sacrifice of a Pawn on the Queenside in order to win a piece on the King side is in the style of Spielmann, while the mate threat by the two Rooks on an open board might have been the inspiration for the finish of the Nimzovich-Bernstein game at Carlsbad in 1923. The whole game might have been a breathtaking brilliancy of Alekhine’s - except that it was played by Capablanca! }

{ March of the little pawns Almost every tournament brings its share of
exciting moments, but none I venture to say contributed more than the one
played at Hastings in 1895. To begin with, it brought together the strongest field since the institu tion of International Chess Tourna ments in
1851. Add to this the fact that the world’s leading masters had not met previously in tournament play, and you will have an idea of the interest stirred up by this occa sion. Neither Lasker, Champion of the World, nor Steinitz, the Grand master who was previous holder of the title, had met
each other in tournament play. Nor had either of them ever encountered the mighty Dr. Tarrasch, winner of four Inter national Tournaments in succession. There were other powerful entries too, such as Tschigorin, who had recently drawn a bitterly-fought match with Tarrasch, young Schlechter, whose reputation as a formidable antagonist had preceded him, and the rising stars Janowsky and Mieses, who were known and feared for the vigor of their attacking play. There was the contingent from England, headed by Blackburne and Teichmann, both dangerous obstacles to any aspiring master.
Should these be cleared, there were others - Schiffers, Bardeleben, Walbrodt, Gunsberg, By no stretch of the imagination could the chess-playing public pic ture the unknown Pillsbury as a possible winner of the highest honors. Imagine then the keen interest that arose when this young ster proceeded to win game after game with astonishing ease and accuracy. Imagine if you can the excitement of the spectators when the final round began with Pillsbury leading the field. Three players were in the running for first prize - Pillsbury with 15½ points, Tschigorin with 15, and Lasker with 14½. Lasker, as befitted a World’s Champion, made short work of his opponent, disposing of Burn in 20 moves. Tschigorin had some trouble subduing Schlechter, but eventually won a long game. Pillsbury, meanwhile, thinking that a draw would be sufficient to win the tournament, played the opening of his game against Guns berg tamely, allowing most of the pieces to be exchanged. Sud denly aware of the danger of being overtaken, Pillsbury began to play with the energy and brilliance with which he had previously mowed down Tarrasch, Steinitz, Janowsky, Pollock and Burn. His
admirable handling of the endgame has been well described by Reinfeld: “Suddenly things began to happen at Pillsbury’s board: the colorless King and Pawn ending came to life. Pillsbury sacrificed a precious Pawn - or did he lose it? He allowed Gunsberg menacing passed Pawns on both sides, rushing down to Queen. It seemed impossible that Pillsbury’s King could hold back the Pawns on both wings. The excitement in the tournament room mounted un bearably as the realization of Pills bury’s predicament became clear to the spectators. Only one man was calm - perhaps deceptively calm: Pillsbury. He had calculated every thing down to the most delicate detail. With the white-hot inspira tion of unique genius, he had in tuitively sensed the possibilities of a seemingly sterile position; with inexorable accuracy he had worked out the subtly timed win. In a few moves, the ending wound up as Pillsbury had foreseen: Gunsberg resigned.” So beautifully did Pillsbury con duct this e }
1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. e3 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 { Lasker says of this, “Black chooses a peculiar, but not altogether sound
manner of development. The objection to this mode of bringing the Bishop
out is that it costs two moves, brings the Bishop on a line that is blocked, and allows the first player possibilities of a King side attack beginning
with h4.” Tartakover, on the other hand, approves of this formation, saying, “A profound conception, a combination of the Queen’s Gambit and the King’s Fianchetto. } 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Ne5 dxc4 8. Bxc4 Nd5 9. f4 Be6 { Whenever a piece lacks Pawn protection, it is in danger. Here,

{ Irrestible Pawn Roller Capablanca demonstrates the pro cess of winning,
in his usual effortless style. Though Marshall makes no conspicuous errors,
Capablanca manages to obtain a Queen side majority of Pawns in only fifteen moves. This slight positional advantage is enough, in the hands of
Capablanca, to be decisive. The Pawns advance at every opportunity, and their steady pro gress eventually compels Marshall to give up a piece to prevent one of them from Queening. The continua tion from that point on is unusually interesting. In only fourteen more moves, Capablanca who has won a
Bishop for two Pawns, weaves an air-tight mating net around Mar shall’s King. Commenting on the game, Lasker (who was not given to uninhibited praise of his peers) said, “Capablanca’s play is an example of how slight advantages should be utilized.” }

{ Quiet, Like a Tiger One of America’s leading players once said to me that
he liked games where nothing happens. This one of Botvinnik’s, I am sure,
would please him. There are little combina tions in the game, but they appear only in the notes. Botvinnik wins the game purely by strength of
position. Control of the d-file, with emphasis on the key square d5, enables his pieces to penetrate the adverse position. The exchanges which take place about the 30th move clear off some of the heavy pieces, and leave Botvinnik a Pawn ahead in a Rook and Pawn ending. He wins it in a breeze. }

{ Cornucopia of Ideas This is one of those unknown masterpieces that
bubbles over with good things. Among the strategic ideas you will see is a
position held in complete restraint by virtue of control of the white squares, permitting the King to wander casually over to the Queen side as
a prelude to the decisive combination. After a tactical interlude, involving a sacrifice of the exchange, there follows a vivid demonstration of the power of a Rook on the seventh rank. And, since chess is cruel, there is a massacre of the innocents - the hap less Pawns being the victims }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 { Restraint is the essence of the Nimzo-Indian - a sound, fighting de fense

his opponent with a doubled Pawn by … ♗xc3, thus providing him with a good object of attack. } 4. e3 b6 5. Be2 Bb7 6. Bf3? { A strategic error, since the ex change of Bishops is to Black’s

{ Endgame duel: Knight against Rook This is a glorious game of Botvinnik’s,
worthy to rank with his famous victory over Capablanca at Avro in 1938. The
game is fascinating through out its length, from the opening that Botvinnik conducts in original style, through the midgame where the sacrifice of the
exchange permits his Rook to dominate the board, to the ending where his agile Knight dances rings around the opposing Rook. A great deal may be learned from this game, but more than that, it is a game that one plays over and over again with renewed pleasure each time, as one takes delight in reading
over and over again a fantastic tale of John Collier’s or a priceless pastiche by Perelman. }

is always on the lookout for brilliancies, might say to himself, “Wouldn’t it be nice if I could play 21 ♘dc4 and then 22 ♘d6 mate?” The master player, I assure you, gives this possibility little more than a passing thought. What concerns him, at this and other stages, is that all his pieces be
in active play. If they are not effectively placed, he moves them (by retreat if neces sary) to squares where they can exert some influence. He gives more thought to this, which is the substance of position play, than to the planning of intricate combinations.

{ Perennial Favorite Back in 1933, when Fred Reinfeld and I were
enthusiastically analyzing thousands of master games to find The Fifty
Greatest Chess Games Ever Played, one of the undisputed choices on any of the lists (and we made many of them) was the magni ficent game won
by Réti from Bogol yubov in 1923. In our introduction to the game, we had this to say of it: “It is well known that an attack undertaken without adequate means must result in loss of the initiative, if parried properly. This is demon strated most convincingly in the present
game - the chief interest of which lies in the harmonious simplicity of Réti’s beautifully-timed play. The unusual movements of the Knight add a certain piquancy to Black’s artistic conduct of the game. Réti’s play is versatile: he per forms many tasks here, and per forms them well. He thrusts back a premature attack, he demonstrates the power of a compact center, he steadily cuts down his opponent’s mobility, he maneuvers his Knights with exquisite skill, he obtains and exploits a passed Pawn according to plan.” Today, having played through and
analyzed thousands of games in the thirty-year interval, the game be tween Bogolyubov and Réti is still, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful and instructive ever played. }

{ Command of the board Rubinstein’s games flow along so smoothly and
easily, and are so pleasant to play over, that one is apt to forget that
they also offer valuable instruction. The importance of centralizing the pieces, for instance, is some thing the chess writers keep on stressing
in their chapters on strategy. That centralization should of itself confer enough advantage to be decisive seems almost incredible, and yet Rubinstein asks for nothing more. In the midgame, with his King and Bishop close to the center, his Knight standing on e5, and a Rook dominating
the seventh rank, Rubinstein is complete master of the situation. Given such superiority in the midgame, it is no wonder he plays the ending in exquisite style! The whole game, including as bonnebouche a journey by the King to the stronghold of the enemy, is a treat. It is one of Rubinstein’s finest efforts. }

{ The King takes a walk In a midgame position with all the pieces still on
the board, Botvinnik makes a few deft moves - and magically the scene is
transformed. The midgame has suddenly become an endgame, with two of Botvinnik’s Pawns close to the Queening square. Some pretty play follows in which
the King takes an important part, when once again there is a sudden change. The passed Pawns disappear - both of them given away to simplify the position - and Botvinnik can win in any way he pleases. }

inappropriate to stop the play for a while, and listen to the advice of the great masters on the role of the King in the endings. Steinitz: In the
ending the King is a powerful piece for assisting his own Pawns, or stopping the adverse Pawns. Tarrasch: It cannot be too greatly emphasized that the most important role in Pawn endings is played by the King. Capablanca: The King, which during the opening and middle-game stage is often a
burden because it has to be defended, becomes in the end game a very important and aggres sive piece, and the beginner should realize this, and utilize his King as much as possible. Nimzovich: The great mobility of the King forms one of the chief characteristics of all endgame strategy. In the middle game the King is a mere ‘super,’ in the endgame on the other hand - one of the ‘principals.’ We must therefore develop him, bring him nearer the fighting line. Znosko-Borovsky: The King plays a most important part in the end game, and gains in power and activity as the number of
pieces on the board diminishes. Acting in eight different directions, he becomes, instead of the weakest piece, one of the most formidable units. Fine: The King is a strong piece; use it! } { [%csl Rh6] } 34... a5 (34... Rh8 35. Kg6 { [%csl Rh6][%cal Gg6g7] } 35... h5 36. Kg7 Re8 37. c4 $18) 35.

{ Surprise! Surprise! More than 400 years ago, the great player Ruy Lopez
(after whom the strongest King side opening was named) recommended as good
tac tics placing the board so that the sun shone in the opponent’s eyes! The chess masters of today have no need of such devices. There are subtler
ways to distract an opponent. Here, the wily Petrosian conjures up various threats against a Pawn on the Queen side of the board. Pachman is kept busy defending that area, when suddenly there comes a blazing Queen sacrifice on the King side which catches Pachman completely off-balance. This
startling move is followed by a quiet move, and out of nowhere there appears a threat of mate - a threat which cannot be staved off. When so eminent a theoretician as Pachman can be caught by surprise almost in the opening, there is reason to believe that the rest of us can also learn something from Petrosian’s ideas in this game }

compare the two positions: Black’s Queen Rook and Queen Bishop are undeveloped, while his Queen is tied down to the defense of two weak Pawns.
On the King side, Black’s Knight is pinned, his Bishop must guard the Knight, and the King must guard the Bishop which guards the Knight. White, on the other hand, bears down on two semi-open files with his Rooks, has two strongly centralized pieces in his Knight and Bishop, and
dominates the long diagonal with his Queen and King Bishop. This is position play par excellence } 18. Re4 Rd8 { Black does not suspect anything! He could have held out longer (if there

{ Bolt from the Blue For the connoisseur of combination play, this game is
a sheer delight. From the lightning-like sacrifice which initiates a threat
of mate, and the further sacrifice which leads to the imprisonment of Black’s Royal Family, and finally to the triumphant march of a passed Pawn, it
sizzles with brilliant ideas. For the player who is anxious to increase his strength, this game is enlightening. The principles of chess strategy come to life in the course of the game, and make its outcome almost inevitable. In the opening, White acquires a clear advantage in position before
striking the first blow. In the mid-game, superiority in position enables White’s lesser forces to hold the enemy in complete restraint. In the ending, White’s clever sim plification sweeps away all the pieces, leaving a position with Pawns only on the board - the easiest sort of ending to win. The whole of this is effected with the consummate artistry of a master player }

{ Lured into Zugzwang It would be an exaggeration to say that the master
strategist is always more than a match for the attacking player. But how
the latter can be made to look helpless! For example, out of all the tournament and match games, 69 in total, played by Capablanca against such
great masters of attack as Janowsky, Marshall, Yates, Colle, Bogolyubov, Mieses and Tartakover, he lost only two games! In the game that follows, Capablanca sacrifices a Pawn in the early middle game to secure an advantage in position. In a short while (such is the efficacy of this strategy)
Marshall’s pieces are completely tied up. A Knight that is under attack must stay where it is, while neither of the two Rooks protecting the Knight dares move away from the file it occupies. The King - well, the King by himself can do very little. All that is left to Marshall are some feeble moves by his Pawns. When these die out, Marshall tries a swindle or two. The swindles come to nothing, and Marshall must turn down his King in surrender. Capablanca’s conduct of the game is truly impressive. It is as fine an illustration of The Power of Position Play as you will ever see. }

{ The flash of a mighty surprise One of the beauties of chess is that it
never lacks surprises. Even the greatest masters are caught unawares at
times. Take this game for instance, where Bobby Fischer plays to win a Rook for his Knight. Picture his astonishment to discover that he has been
lured into a deeply-hidden trap. In order to win the exchange, Fischer has had to weaken his Kingside ever so slightly, and this weakness is exploited by Olafsson through a series of clever moves. For a while it looks as though Fischer will equalize, but Olafsson plays it in fine style, and
his position gains quietly in strength. With the creation of two connected passed Pawns, its power becomes irresistible. Olafsson’s play is elegant throughout, and this game of his is a jewel in the treasury of modern chess. }

{ Symphony of heavenly length To call this game a masterpiece is to do it
insufficient justice. It is more than that. It is a symphony played over a
chessboard with an orchestra of pieces and Pawns. It consists of four movements, whose style and tempo may be described as follows: (1) The Minority
Attack - lively and with vigor, (this is the dominant theme of the movement, and determines the play of the entire composi tion). (2) The Knight’s Tour - lightly and gracefully. (3) The Rook’s Maneuvers - with energy and spirit. (4) The Pawn Finale - simply and precisely. You may get the idea from
the foregoing that I am wild about this game, and that I wish it lasted more than the 81 moves it does. If you do, then I have conveyed the right impression }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Qc2 O-O 7. cxd5 exd5 { The Exchange Variation, a line of play which has long been a favorite
with masters of disparate styles - Marshall, Keres, Reshevsky and
Botvinnik. Apparently it has something to offer the tactician as well as the strategist. The exchange of the center Pawns seems to free Black’s
game, but certain weaknesses remain in his Queenside Pawn structure. These are susceptible to the so-called Minority Attack. This is a remarkable concept as it involves an assault on three Pawns by only two Pawns! Its purpose is to split up Black’s Pawn majority and leave him with an
isolated Pawn that is difficult to defend. } 8. Nf3 c6 { Black supports the center Pawn, and provides an outlet for his Queen. } 9. Bd3 Re8 { The Rook moves toward the cen ter, where it will exert pressure on the
half-open file. Meanwhile the square f1 is made available to the Queen
Knight, which will help defend the King side. } 10. O-O Nf8 11. Rab1 { The beginning of the Minority Attack. The Rook supports the b-Pawn, which
will advance to b4 and b5, with the idea of breaking up Black’s Queen side
Pawns. } 11... Ne4 { An attempt to stop the Minority Attack by 11 … a5 would only be a
temporary deterrent, since White could pursue his plan by 12 a3 and 13 b4. } (11... a5 12. a3) 12. Bxe7 (12. Nxe4 dxe4 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 { and Black wins a piece by the Pawn fork. }) 12... Qxe7 13. b4 a6 { ready to meet an eventual b5 with axb5, opening a file for his Queen
Rook. } 14. a4 Nxc3 15. Qxc3 Bg4 16. Nd2 Qg5 { [%emt 0:00:17] With the transparent threat of 17 … ♗h3,
winning the exchange. } { [%cal Gg4h3] } 17. Rfc1 Re6 { Black plays for a King side attack, not only because his chances lie in
that area, but to divert White from carrying out his designs on the other
wing. } 18. b5! { White is not to be dissuaded! He intends to force exchanges which will
leave Black with a permanently weak Pawn position on the Queen side. } 18... axb5 (18... cxb5 19. axb5 { [%csl Rb7,Rd5] }) 19. axb5 { Now we see one of the likely consequences of the breakthrough. If Black
were to play 19 … cxb5, the recapture would leave him with two weak
isolated Pawns - the b-Pawn and the d-Pawn. These would make fine objects of attack for White. } 19... Bh3 20. g3 { This weakens the white squares and creates holes in the position, but as
Nimzovich once said, “We cannot always be happy.” } 20... Rae8 21. bxc6 bxc6 { White has accomplished what he set out to do with the Minority Attack. He
has saddled Black with a backward Pawn on an open file - a Pawn which is
vulnerable to attack, as it dare not advance, and can be defended only with pieces. Against this weakling, White will direct his fire. } 22. Bf1! { Excellent! White sees to it that his King is properly protected before
starting an attack on the weak Pawn. Black must now withdraw his Bishop
from its strongly-placed position, or allow its exchange - either of which will be to White’s advantage. } (22. Rb6 { instead, the consequences would have been painful, the continuation being } 22... Rxe3! 23. fxe3 Qxe3+ 24. Kh1 Qf2 { (threatens mate on the move) } 25. Rg1 Re1 { and White is faced with four
threats of mate on the move! } { [%csl Rg1][%cal Gf2g2,Gh3g2,Ge1g1,Gf2g1] }) 22... Bxf1 23. Nxf1 { The exchange of pieces has notice -ably strengthened
White’s position. The Bishops are off the board, but Black’s (a troublesome
attacking piece) has disappeared, while White’s has been replaced by another piece - the Knight. The Knight, from its modest post at f1, securely
guards the g-Pawn and the e-Pawn, the two vulnerable points in White’s King side position. Any hopes Black had of breaking through by a sacrifice at e3, are now shattered. Another consideration in White’s favor is that any further exchanges of pieces will accentuate the weakness of the
unfortunate c- Pawn. } { [%csl Ge3,Gg3] } 23... Ng6 24. Rb6 Ne7 { All points are safeguarded, but Black is restricted to defensive
measures, while his opponent can trouble him with all manner of threats. } 25. Qb4 h5 { Primarily, this is to provide the King with
a flight square against threats of mate on the back rank, but Black also
has visions of starting an attack by 25 … h4 and 26 … hxg3. } { [%csl Yh7][%cal Gh5h4,Gh4g3] } 26. Rb8 { White is of course anxious to bring it to an endgame by exchanging as
many pieces as possible. } 26... Rxb8 27. Qxb8+ Kh7 28. Qf4! Qxf4 29. gxf4 { The disappearance of the Queens puts an end to any possibility of Black’s
conjuring up a Kingside attack, and brings matters to an ending, where
White has all the winning chances. } 29... g6 30. Nd2 { The Knight heads for c5, where it can occupy
a fine outpost, and blockade the backward Pawn } { [%csl Gc5][%cal Gd2b3,Gb3c5] } 30... Rd6 { Black also seeks to improve his position, by maneuvering the Rook over to
an open file. } 31. Kf1 Kg7 { The Kings too move toward the center, where they can take an active part
in the endgame. } 32. Ra1 { An attempt to seize control of the seventh rank … } 32... Rd7 { … which is promptly repulsed. } 33. Nb3 Rb7 (33... Rc7) 34. Nc5 Rb2 { better than more passive R-B2 } 35. Ra7 Kf6 36. Ra6 { Evans wastes a few moves here before hitting on the decisive com
bination, but he may have been in time pressure. } 36... Rb1+ 37. Kg2 Rb2 38. Ra7 Rb1 39. Rc7! { Finally getting behind the Pawn. Black is now held in a
tight grip, his King and Knight being unable to move without loss of
material. } { [%csl Re7,Rf6] } 39... Ra1 40. Nd3 Ke6 (40... Ra2 { [%cal Rf2f3,Re3e4] } 41. Nb4 Rb2 42. Nxc6 Rc2 43. Nxe7! Rxc7 44. Nxd5+ { and White regains the Rook, winning a piece and the game }) 41. Nc5+! { The beginning of a remarkable Knight’s tour (reminiscent of the famous
